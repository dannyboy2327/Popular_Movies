# Popular Movies Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed the **Popular Movies** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project
User Interface (Function), Network API Implementation, User Interface (Layout), Data Persistence, and
Android Architecture Components are a common task for Android Developers. 

## What I Learned?
Through this project:
- Learned how apply Android Architecture Components (View-Models, Live-Data, and Room)  
- Practiced JSON parsing to a model object (Using library named Retrofit2)
- Designed an activity layout (With the help of Picasso Library)
- Populated all fields in the layout accordingly 

## How I Completed this Project?
Designed the layout for the Popular Movies App so that each movie's poster was
displayed in a sensible way. Implemented Retrofit2 to easily parse data for 
each movie to layout each movies details layout. Created a settings to load movies 
based on preference from: popular, top-rated, and favorites. Also provided different 
endpoints to obtain each movie object's trailers and reviews.
